[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/clio/lib-themisui.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/clio/lib-themisui)

ThemisUI is a shareable suite of components and brand assets to be shared across Themis projects. ThemisUI also contains a docs viewer to allow for simple consumption of components.


## Usage

We're running in stealth mode for now meaning we don't yet want to list on NPM. So to install run:

```bash
npm install git+ssh://git@github.com/clio/lib-themisui.git#v0.2.1
```

You can specify [any other release](https://github.com/clio/lib-themisui/releases) as well.

Next you just need to include ThemisUI in your angular application like so:

```javascript
angular = require('angular');

angular.module 'YourApp', [
    require 'lib-ThemisUI'
];
```

You can now use any of our components in your application. The APIs for each component explain their usage.
